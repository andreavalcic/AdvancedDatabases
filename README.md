# AdvancedDatabases
Projects for the Advanced Databases course.

The projects were done locally so I added them as rar files.

1st Project (Prvi projekat.rar) - Windows Forms App "TechShop" that uses Neo4j.
2nd Project (Drugi projekat.rar) - Windows Forms App "AudioHouse Assistant" that uses Apache Cassandra.
3rd Project (Treci projekat.rar) - Windows Forms App "Preschool Assistant" that uses MongoDB.
